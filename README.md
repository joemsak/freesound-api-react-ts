## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Freesound API credentials

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:joemsak/freesound-api-react-ts.git
cd freesound-api-react-ts
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_FREESOUND_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
VITE_FREESOUND_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
VITE_FREESOUND_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
```

### Getting Freesound API Credentials

1. Visit [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org)
2. Create an account or log in
3. Go to [API Access](https://freesound.org/apiv2/apply/) to apply for API access
4. Once approved, you'll receive:

   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
   - API Token (for direct API access)

### Development

Start the dev server with HMR:

```bash
vite dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (Vite's default port).

### Build

Build for production (outputs to `dist/`):

```bash
vite build
```

### Preview

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
vite preview
```

## Usage

### Home Page

- Search for sounds using the search bar
- Discover "Sound of the Day" - a randomly selected sound
- Browse "New Sounds" - latest uploads from Freesound

### Search

- Enter keywords in the search bar (available in navigation or home page)
- Browse paginated results with numbered pagination
- Click any sound card to view details
- Click usernames to view their profile
- Click tags to search for sounds with that tag

### Sound Details

- View full sound information including metadata, description, and tags
- Preview audio with waveform visualization
- Add to favorites
- Navigate to uploader's profile
- View on Freesound.org

### Favorites

- Click the star icon on any sound to add it to favorites
- Access favorites via the sidebar (toggle button in navigation)
- Favorites persist across sessions using localStorage
- Play favorites directly from the sidebar

### Fixed Audio Player

- Audio continues playing when navigating between pages
- Fixed footer player shows current track information
- Control playback from any page
- Add/remove favorites directly from the player

## Architecture Highlights

### Caching Strategy

- Search results and sound data are cached for 5 minutes
- Cache persists across page reloads using localStorage
- Automatic cache expiration and cleanup
- Reduces API calls and improves performance

### Rate Limiting

- Built-in client-side rate limiter prevents API throttling
- Respects Freesound API limits (60 requests/minute, 2000/day)
- Queues requests and introduces delays when needed

### Single Audio Playback

- Global audio player context ensures only one track plays at a time
- Automatically pauses previous track when new one starts
- Synchronized playback state across components

### Component Organization

- **Components**: Reusable UI elements (buttons, cards, players)
- **Screens**: Page-level components (Home, Search, Detail)
- **Contexts**: Global state management (favorites, cache, audio)
- **Hooks**: Reusable logic (caching, pagination, async effects)

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables:
- `VITE_FREESOUND_CLIENT_ID` - Freesound API Client ID
- `VITE_FREESOUND_CLIENT_SECRET` - Freesound API Client Secret
- `VITE_FREESOUND_API_TOKEN` - Freesound API Token (recommended for better rate limits)
